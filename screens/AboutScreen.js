It is estimated that in cases where production is out sourced to a developing world country, workersâ€™ wages only account for between 0.5-4% of the final retail cost of a garment. Guardian, (2012).

            <Text style={styles.font}> Companies that follow sustainable practices are helping to minimise the large negative impact that the fashion industry has on the environment. Companies can do this by using non-toxic dyes that will not affect the environment when they are leached into water ways. More and more companies are using recycled fabrics which save a lot of energy and reduces pollution.
